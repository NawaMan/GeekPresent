<!--
  The handout — one deck, every slide, one printable document.

  Ctrl+P on a slide prints that slide, because each slide is its own SvelteKit document;
  that is the deck being honest about what it is, and it is no use to someone who wants
  the talk as a PDF. This route is the other artifact: it stacks all of a deck's slides
  into a single page and gives the printer the two rules it needs — a sheet the shape of
  the slide (`@page { size }`) and a break after each one. The browser is the PDF engine,
  so there is no export pipeline and no dependency; `Ctrl+P → Save as PDF` is the feature.

  It renders the REAL slide components, globbed from the routes (handoutDecks.ts) — not a
  copy, not a screenshot. So a handout cannot drift from the deck, and the slide you print
  is the slide you present, ink and all.

  Three things it does NOT do, each on purpose:

  - It is not a Text. text.html is a hand-authored document that happens to share the
    components; its own body says a Text "is not a stack of slides glued together". This
    IS the stack of slides, deliberately, and the two answer different questions.
  - It does not mount <SlideDeck>. The deck shell is a viewport — scaling, panning, chrome,
    and a slot gated on `initialized` so nothing renders before the browser arrives. A
    document wants none of that, and wants the opposite of the last: the slides must be in
    the prerendered HTML. So the handout publishes the deck's own context (setPages) and
    renders the slides directly, which is why they SSR here and nowhere else.
  - It does not pretend about embeds. A <WebSite>/<WebPage>/<YouTube> slide is a live
    <iframe>, and a printer hands you a blank rectangle for one. The handout finds them
    (captureCore.findBlockers — the same scan, the same reason, as CAPTURE's refusal) and
    NAMES them on the sheet in ink, so the reader knows a live thing stood there.
