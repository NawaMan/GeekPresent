  AppendixPage — a slide you jump INTO and return FROM. A slide as a function call,
  rather than a destination.

  The deep-dive a talk only sometimes needs: a proof, a full API table, a backup
  demo. It behaves like a real book's appendix, and that is the whole design:

    - It is a CHAPTER, not a slide. Give several slides `hidden: true`, contiguously
      in pages.ts, and PREV/NEXT page through them exactly as they page through the
      body of the deck. FIRST/LAST are the appendix's own ends, not the deck's.

    - The ordinary forward march RETURNS from it. Page off the end of the run — NEXT,
      →, or Space, whichever the speaker reaches for — and you land back on the slide
      that called you. Page back off the front and you land there too. So there is
      nothing new to learn: you leave an appendix by walking out of it. RETURN (and
      Backspace) are the shortcut, for leaving from the middle.

    - `hidden` is OPTIONAL. It makes the appendix a DETOUR: off the linear order, so
      a straight run-through of the deck never wanders in. Leave it off and the same
      appendix sits in the deck's normal flow — back matter you can simply page into,
      the way a book lets you — and still returns to a caller that jumped in.

  Usage — the appendix's own +page.svelte:

    <script>
      import AppendixPage from '$lib/templates/AppendixPage.svelte';
    </script>

    <AppendixPage title="How the GC actually marks">
      <p>The long version, for when someone asks.</p>
    </AppendixPage>

  and its pages.ts entries — contiguous, and `hidden` if it should be a detour:

    { path: "appendix-gc.html",   title: "Appendix — GC",            hidden: true },
    { path: "appendix-gc-2.html", title: "Appendix — Write barriers", hidden: true },

  THE RETURN ADDRESS rides in the URL — `?return=heap-layout.html`, stamped by the
  AppendixLink that called us — not in a store. So it survives a reload, and it is
  legible: a speaker can see where RETURN goes by reading the address bar. Every link
  within the appendix re-stamps it, so paging deeper never loses the way home.

  It is also, therefore, untrusted; utils/appendixCore.ts validates it and refuses
  anything that is not a plain in-deck slide name. With no usable address (a direct
  link, a bookmark, a refused one) the way out becomes the deck's first slide and the
  control reads DECK — an appendix must never strand you, since it is off the linear
  order and the browser's Back button would otherwise be the only way out.

  Props: title / subtitle / rule / align — and style / id / class — pass straight through
  to ContentPage — an appendix is an ordinary slide, laid out normally. Only its
  NAVIGATION differs.

    returnText — label for the return control (default 'RETURN').
    deckText   — label when there is no return address (default 'DECK').
    transition — animate the detour: leaving the appendix travels back UP (whichever
                 control does it — the appendix sinks away and the caller drops back
                 into place), and paging within it steps sideways like the rest of the
                 deck. The mirror image of the AppendixLink you travelled down through,
                 so set it on both. Default false — an animated navigation must
                 be a CLIENT-SIDE one (the View Transitions API cannot cross a
                 document), and Monaco does not survive that: an animated appendix
                 must use SourceView/QuickCode, never ViewSource/Code/CodeBox. See
                 SourceView.svelte and the memory "monaco-breaks-on-spa-nav".
