// Who owns a draggable's geometry: the props, or the author's `style`?
//
// Every author-facing component takes a `style` prop that is appended LAST on the
// root element, so the author's declaration outranks the component's own rules
// (see AGENTS.md, "Give it `style`, `id` and `class`"). On a LAYOUT-draggable
// shape that rule has one pathological case: `Block` writes its box as inline
// `left/top/width/height`, and an author's `style="left: 40px"` lands in the SAME
// declaration block — where the last declaration simply wins. The DOM keeps ONE
// `left`, and it is the author's:
//
//     <Block name="db" x={200} style="left: 40px">
//     -> left: 40px; top: 300px; width: 400px; height: 160px;   (x={200} is gone)
//
// LAYOUT then drags a box that cannot move: `x` tracks the pointer, the readout
// climbs, SAVE dutifully writes `x={640}` to source — and on screen, nothing.
// LAYOUT looks broken while behaving exactly as specified.
//
// The rule this module encodes: THE PROPS OWN THE GEOMETRY. `style` is for
// cosmetics — stroke, dash, colour, a decorative `rotate()`. The handful of
// properties a Block actually writes are RESERVED: they are filtered out of the
// author's style before it is appended, so what you see always matches x/y/width/
// height and the drag is honest. Everything else passes through untouched and
// still wins, exactly as before.
//
// Reserving is not the same as rewriting. The author's source `style` is left
// alone (Copy/Save echo it back verbatim); the stray declaration just stops
// having an effect, and LAYOUT-mode chrome says so. Nothing is guessed, nothing
// is silently edited on disk.
//
// Pure and browser-free, so it unit-tests without a DOM (tests/styleGuardCore.test.ts).

/** Properties a draggable writes itself, so an author's `style` must not.
 *
 *  `left/top/width/height` are what `Block` puts in its inline style, and what
 *  an SVG `<rect>` (Draw's `Rect`) carries as presentation attributes — which
 *  ANY css, inline style included, outranks. `x`/`y` are the CSS geometry
 *  properties for that same `<rect>`; on an HTML Block they are inert, so
 *  dropping them costs nothing and the warning still reads true. `inset*` are
 *  shorthands for left/top, and `position` decides whether left/top apply at all.
 *
 *  Deliberately NOT reserved, because each has a legitimate cosmetic use that
 *  reserving would break, and none of them actually contends with the geometry:
 *    - `right` / `bottom` — over-constrained against `left`+`width`, so CSS
 *      ignores them outright. Reserving would warn about a no-op.
 *    - `margin` — `margin: 0` is common and harmless on an absolute box.
 *    - `transform` / `translate` — `rotate()` and `scale()` are real authoring
 *      tools and must keep working. A translate DOES displace the box (see
 *      `offsets` below), but it is reported, not stripped.
 *    - `rx` / `ry` — Draw's `Rect` uses `rx` for CORNER ROUNDING while `Ellipse`
 *      uses rx/ry as RADII. One name, two meanings; reserving it would break
 *      rounded rects to guard a case nobody authors.
