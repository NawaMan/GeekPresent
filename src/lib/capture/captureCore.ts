/*
  Capture — the pure decision layer behind the slide screenshot (see capture/captureSlide.ts,
  which owns the impure half: fetching, rasterising, downloading).

  The whole point of capturing a GeekPresent slide rather than screenshotting the window is
  that the slide has a TRUE size. The deck is authored on a fixed 1920x1080 canvas and merely
  *displayed* at whatever scale the window allows, so a screen grab hands you 1147x645 of
  someone's laptop, while re-rendering the DOM hands you exactly the canvas, identical on
  every machine. That is what this does: clone the canvas, inline everything it depends on,
  and rasterise it through an SVG <foreignObject> at canvas resolution.

  Side-effect free and total, in the drawCore/annotateCore tradition. The DOM-reading helpers
  here take an Element and return data — they never mutate, so they stay directly testable.

/** What a capture cannot draw. There is exactly one kind that is genuinely impossible rather
    than merely fiddly, and it is worth being precise about why: an `<iframe>` is a separate
    document. Its pixels live in another browsing context that we may not read (that is the
    same-origin policy doing its job, not a gap in the implementation), and cloning the
    `<iframe>` element clones an empty frame. So a slide built on `WebSite`, `WebPage` or a
    `YouTube` embed cannot be rasterised, and no amount of care changes that.

    `<canvas>` and `<video>` LOOK like the same problem and are not — their pixels are readable
    from this document, so captureSlide snapshots them into `<img>`s rather than refusing. */

    second list that would drift. That includes the pen's own bar, toggle and stale-ink prompt
    — but NOT `.annot-surface`, which is the ink itself. The annotations are the whole reason a
    speaker wants a screenshot: they circled the thing, and the circle has to be in the PNG.

/** Make a stylesheet safe to embed in the SVG, which is XML and not HTML.

    This is the bug that made the first version refuse to draw ANY slide, and it is worth
    stating plainly because nothing about it is obvious. The deck's compiled CSS contains

        @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Amatic+SC:wght@400;700&display=swap");

    In HTML a bare `&` is tolerated. In XML it is the start of an entity reference, so the
    document is MALFORMED — and a malformed SVG is not partially drawn, it is rejected whole.
    The browser then fires `onerror` with no explanation, which reads as "the browser refused
    to draw this slide" and gives you nothing to go on. One ampersand, in a font import, kills
    the entire screenshot.

    So: escape `&` and `<` (the XML parser decodes them back before the CSS parser ever sees
    them, so the CSS is unchanged), and DROP `@import` outright. The drop is not belt-and-braces
    — an SVG rendered as an image may not fetch external resources at all, so an `@import` in
    there is dead weight at best. The imported sheet's *content* is pulled in separately and
    inlined (see captureSlide.collectCss), which is the only way those fonts can arrive. */

    stylesheets, its fonts or its images. Anything not carried across simply is not there, and
    the failure is silent: the text renders in Times New Roman and the layout quietly shifts.
