<!--
  Spotlight — the note-driven highlight overlay.

  Mounted ONCE per deck by SlideDeck (a canvas-level singleton, like the minimap),
  so no slide has to place it. It is inert until something sets the `highlightTarget`
  store: then it looks that name up in the SAME blockAnchors registry a <Connector>
  resolves against, dims the rest of the canvas, and rings the named Block's box —
  so the spotlight follows the box even as it is dragged in LAYOUT mode, and needs
  not one coordinate authored.

  What SETS the store is usually a <Note> line carrying `data-highlight="db"`: as the
  speaker covers that line in the presenter console, it publishes the name over the
  same localStorage relay as `publishContinue`, the audience window's SlideDeck hears
  it and calls `setHighlight`, and this overlay lights the box on the live slide — a
  laser pointer the audience sees, drawn in canvas space, so the console's preview
  shows it too for free. A slide can also drive `setHighlight` directly (a button, a
  Steps build); the overlay does not care who set the store.

  Rendering mirrors a standalone <Connector>: one canvas-spanning <svg>, always
  `pointer-events: none` (inline, so it never eats a click even before CSS lands).
  The dim is a full-canvas <rect> with the target box punched out of it by an SVG
  <mask>; the ring is a stroked <rect> over the same box. When no name is set — or a
  name resolves to no anchor — it renders NOTHING, so it is SSR-inert (nothing is
  highlighted at prerender) and cannot ship a stray box.
