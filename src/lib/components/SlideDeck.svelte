<!--
  SlideDeck — the reusable shell for a Presentation artifact.

  A Presentation is many discrete, fixed-size slide pages. This component is the
  whole canvas: it draws a fixed width x height box and shows it in one of two
  display modes (see $lib/stores/displayMode):
    - FITTED: scale the box to fit the window, preserving aspect (present mode).
    - SCALED: show the box at an exact factor (1 = native px), centred and
      pannable when it overflows the window (inspect mode), with a minimap.
  It also mounts the slide chrome (Table of Contents, display-mode control,
  copyright). The slides themselves flow in via the default <slot/>.

  Orientation lives HERE, set by a deck's +layout.svelte through the width/height
  props — never a runtime toggle. A landscape deck wraps its <slot/> in
  <SlideDeck width={1920} height={1080}>; a portrait deck (e.g. a YouTube Short)
  uses <SlideDeck width={1080} height={1920}>. Each slide's layout is authored
  for its deck's fixed dimension, so a deck is landscape OR portrait, full stop.

  Note: the deck's +layout.svelte must still call setPages(pages) itself — the
  slotted slide content is lexically owned by the layout, so it reads the
  layout's context, not this component's. `pages` is passed here only for the
  Table of Contents rendered inside this shell.

	   styles, because on screen they must track the window. A print stylesheet cannot
	   out-specify an inline style — it can only override it — so the deck's screen
	   geometry has to be retracted by name and replaced with the paper's.

	   The document itself has to be unwound too: `.viewport` is `position: fixed` (a
	   window is one screenful, so a fixed pane is right there and useless here), and
	   global.css centres `body` in a flex box for the same reason. On paper both must
	   simply flow, or the sheet comes out empty and the slide comes out somewhere else. */

		   Which is what `min-height: 100vh` did here, and it is worth recording. It was meant to

		   evenly. But `vh` in print is the page box, and a body forced to a full page tall, inside

		   one page — so it printed as three sheets, blank / slide / blank. Chrome's own
		   print-to-PDF happened to absorb it; other engines did not, which is exactly the kind of

		   Chrome, when laying out for PRINT, measures an absolutely-positioned element inside
		   a `transform: scale()`d ancestor WITHOUT applying the transform. The copyright is
		   anchored to the canvas's right edge, so its unscaled left edge sits at 1674px; the
		   paper is 1280px; Chrome concludes the page overflows and SHRINKS THE WHOLE SHEET to
		   1280/1674 = 0.7645 to make it fit. Every slide in the deck then printed at
		   three-quarter size, with white margins, and nothing in the DOM looked wrong —
		   `scrollWidth` is 1280, and under `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia` the box measures
		   correctly. Only the PDF was wrong. (`overflow: clip` and `contain: paint` on the
		   frame do not help; the phantom overflow is computed before either applies.)

		   So the copyright does not print — which is also simply right, and what the deck
		   already does under `?clean`: the HANDOUT prints no watermark on its sheets either, so
		   a printed slide and that slide inside a handout now agree, to the pixel.

		   the slide and sits BESIDE it, squeezing the slide to two-thirds of the page.

		   The frame turns white for the band (the slide's own dark surface is painted by
