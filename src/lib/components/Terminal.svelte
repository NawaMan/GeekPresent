<!--
  Terminal — a fake console: a typed command, then its output.

  The tech-talk staple. A command types itself out character by character behind a
  prompt, the console pauses as if thinking, and the output lands line by line.

  A Terminal is, in the end, a VIDEO OF A SESSION — so it wears Video's clothes: a
  centre play button, a transport bar, and a marker per command. A presenter already
  knows what those do.

  THE TYPING IS CSS, NOT A TIMER, and everything else follows from that. A finite
  `@keyframes` animation is also a Web Animations object, so the session can be paused,
  seeked and replayed by moving one clock — no timer to desynchronise from the text, and
  a scrub backwards puts every character back where it was. What a timer-driven
  typewriter cannot do, this can.

  CONTROL comes in two flavours, and they are not the same thing:

    - TRANSPORT (`controls`, default on): play / pause, a click-to-seek track, restart,
      and a tick per command. The session opens HELD at frame 0 behind a play button
      unless `autoplay`.
    - STEPPING (`keys="global"`, opt-in): Space plays forward to the end of the next
      command's output and stops there — you watch it type, it halts, you talk.
      Shift+Space jumps back to the previous stop, and from the first one to the
      beginning. Once the last command is behind the playhead, Space falls through and
      PAGES THE DECK, exactly as a <Steps> build does: the Terminal registers with the
      same `activeSteps` store, so `spaceIntent` arbitrates the handoff, and
      NavigationBar's CONTINUE button and the presenter console's `gp:continue` pulse
      drive it for free.

      Space *plays to* the next checkpoint rather than seeking to it — the deliberate
      difference from <Video>, which jumps. Footage is worth jumping through; a
      typewriter you would never see type. Backwards is a jump, because re-watching a
      command type on the way back is nobody's idea of stepping back.

      Both directions walk the SAME stops: `0` (a blank console) and every checkpoint.
      Shift+Space must undo Space, so it cannot step to a command's *start* — that is a
      state no forward step ever produces, and from the first command's start there is
      nothing earlier, so Shift+Space would page the deck away instead of rewinding.

      Opt-in because only ONE build per slide may own Space (a <Steps> run and a
      stepping Terminal would fight over it and over the store).

  ONE OWNER PER CLOCK. <AnimationBar> collects every finite CSS animation in the slide's
  `.content` — including this one's. With `controls` on, the Terminal drives its own
  playhead, so an AnimationBar on the same slide would fight it (its Play would run
  straight past your markers). Pass `controls={false}` to render a bare console and hand
  the clock back to an AnimationBar. That is the only supported way to combine them.

  Usage:

    <script>
      import Terminal from '$lib/components/Terminal.svelte';
    </script>

    <Terminal
      title="zsh — geekpresent"
      keys="global"
      lines={[
        { cmd: 'pnpm build' },
        { out: 'vite v5.4.2 building SSR bundle...' },
        { out: '✓ 42 modules transformed', tone: 'ok' },
        { out: 'warning: 1 chunk is larger than 500 kB', tone: 'warn' },
      ]}
    />

  A bare string in `lines` is shorthand for an output line. Tones are `ok` / `warn` /
  `error` / `muted` / `plain`; every colour is a roles.css token (`--terminal-*`).

  In normal slide flow the console hugs its content. Wrap it in a <Block> to pin and
  size it — Block fills its content by default, so the console stretches to the box and
  the screen scrolls if the session is taller than the space given.

  Not a code viewer: for syntax-highlighted source use Code / CodeBox (Monaco), and for
  a short static snippet use QuickCode.

  It also renders WHOLE on the server: the transcript is in the markup from props alone,
  and the animation only ever hides what is already there. So a `text` artifact ships the
  full session as static HTML. (A SLIDE'S markup never reaches the static build —
  SlideDeck gates its content behind `initialized` — so that benefit is a Text-artifact
  one. What SSR-safety buys a slide is no mount-time flash.)

  Three CSS/DOM mechanics worth knowing before editing:

    - The reveal is the WIDTH of the typed span, clipped to a whole number of `ch` and
      walked by `steps()`. That only means anything in a monospace font — the premise of
      a console anyway.
    - Every reveal keyframe declares only a `from`. The implicit `to` is the property's
      own cascaded value, so one rule serves every line length and every tone (a muted
      line fades 0 → 0.6, not 0 → 1) without generating per-line keyframes.
    - The caret's blink is INFINITE, so it is excluded from the clock: it keeps blinking
      while the session is paused, which is exactly what a real prompt does.
