  Hint — a faint cue pinned to the bottom of the slide.

    <Hint text="Flip ADJUST (top-right) to drag & resize any callout" />

  A Hint floats over whatever the slide happens to put behind it — an image, a
  chart, a live website — so it cannot rely on contrasting with the deck surface.
  Left as bare text it disappears the moment the pixels behind it match its colour.
  It therefore carries its OWN background: a translucent backdrop and a hairline
  rule, both mixed from the --hint-* role tokens, which give the text a legible
  surface of its own on any backdrop while staying quiet enough to read as a cue
  and not as content.

  It rests SEMI-TRANSPARENT and lifts to full opacity on hover/focus — a cue
  should recede while you read the slide and sharpen the moment you look at it —
  and it carries an (X) so a viewer can dismiss it once they've read it. A drag
  grip (like the annotate tool bar's) lets a viewer park it off whatever it lands
  on, and — like the pen's bar — it REMEMBERS that across a page turn, as long as
  the viewer never dismisses it: dismissing (× or double-clicking the grip home)
  resets it, so the next Hint (this slide reloaded, or a later slide's) starts
  fresh rather than inheriting a spot chosen for a cue that's gone. See
  stores/hintPos.ts.

  Props:
    text        — the cue.
    isVisible   — false hides it entirely.
    boxed       — the backdrop + rule (default true). `false` restores the old
                  bare text, for slides that know what sits behind it.
    movable     — offer the drag grip (default true). `false` pins the cue to its
                  resting spot and hides the grip.
    dim         — resting opacity (0–1); lifts to 1 on hover/focus. Unset uses the
                  default 0.4 — faint enough to read as a cue, legible in full on
                  hover. Raise it (dim=0.85) for a slide that wants the cue louder.
    dismissible — show the (X) close button (default true). `false` hides it.
    style       — inline style for the pill, applied last so it wins: e.g.
                  `style="font-size: 0.8em"` for a quieter cue on a busy slide.

  Events:
    close       — fired when the viewer dismisses it via (X). Dismissal is also
                  self-contained: the Hint hides itself, no binding required. It
                  stays dismissed for the life of the slide (each slide is its own
                  page load), so no reset is offered.
