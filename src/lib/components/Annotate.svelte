<!--
  Annotate — the speaker's ink overlay.

  Mounted ONCE per deck by SlideDeck (a canvas-level singleton, like <Spotlight>), so no
  slide has to place it. Inert until the speaker arms ANNOTATE: then the surface takes the
  pointer and freehand strokes land on the live slide — circle the term, underline the line
  of code, cross out the wrong branch. <Spotlight> can already ring a Block, but only one
  the AUTHOR named in advance; this is for what the speaker decides to point at while
  answering a question.

  Geometry is not ours: sampled pointer positions go through annotateCore.simplifyPoints
  and then drawCore's `smoothPath` — the SAME Catmull-Rom smoothing <Polyline> and <Curve>
  render through, so ink inherits the NaN-safe, total discipline the Draw family is already
  tested against, and a stroke is nothing more exotic than a `d` string.

  INK PERSISTS, per slide, across reloads (stores/annotation.inkBook). Two windows share it
  for free — they are the same origin, so the audience's copy of the store hears the
  speaker's strokes through the `storage` event, with no relay to keep in step. The price of
  keeping ink is that it can go STALE, so a slide whose marks are older than a day says so
  on arrival and offers to clear them; RESET (this slide) and RESET ALL live on the bar, and
  again in the presenter console.

  The overlay is still SSR-inert: `persisted` degrades to an empty in-memory book on the
  server, so a prerendered page ships no surface, no listener and no ink — whatever happens
  to be in the author's browser.

  Three z-layers, and the order matters: the ink surface (40) sits over the slide's own
  Blocks; the bar and the ANNOTATE toggle (41/42) sit over the surface, because while the
  pen is armed the surface owns EVERY pointer on the canvas — anything the speaker must
  still be able to click has to out-rank it, or they can arm the pen and never put it down.
