<!--
  Block — an absolutely-positioned, editable wrapper in CANVAS pixels.

  Drop it around any slide content to pin that content at exact (x, y) with a
  fixed (width, height) in the deck's fixed coordinate space (1920x1080 landscape
  by default). Because SlideDeck scales the whole canvas with one CSS transform,
  these coordinates are authored once and scale with the slide in every display
  mode — no per-element math.

      <Block x={120} y={240} width={400} height={160} name="hero">
          <h2>Pinned content</h2>
      </Block>

  The wrapped content fills the box in both axes by default (a resize rubber-bands
  it) — pass `fill={false}` for pure positioning, where the content keeps its
  natural size. When ADJUST mode is ON, the wrapper grows a drag body + a bottom-right
  resize handle + a small toolbar. Dragging updates x/y/width/height live; the
  COPY button writes the updated OPENING tag — just `<Block … x={…} y={…} …>` —
  to the clipboard, so you paste that one line over your element's existing open
  tag (its children and closing tag stay put). A self-closing wrapper (ImageBlock)
  copies as `<Tag … />`. (Snippet-emit, not live source rewrite: what you copy is
  the element's own current props — robust and decoupled from the page text.)

  The drag math divides screen-pixel pointer deltas by the element's LIVE rendered
  scale (getBoundingClientRect().width / offsetWidth), so a drag tracks the cursor
  1:1 whether the deck is FITTED (fit-to-window) or SCALED to any zoom factor.

	/* The style/geometry collision badge — the TOP row of the chrome above the box:
	   badge, then toolbar, then readout, then the box itself.
	   Two things this has to get right, both learned the hard way:
	   1. UNIT BASIS. The offset is in the BLOCK's font-size, not the badge's, because
	      that is the basis `.toolbar` uses (the toolbar row sets no font-size — only
	      its buttons shrink), so its `top: -1.7em` rides far higher than the 0.55em
	      readout's. Sizing this row at 0.55em and then offsetting it by `1.7em` would
	      measure the gap in units ~3x smaller and land the badge straight under the
	      toolbar. The pills carry the font-size instead, so the two rows can't drift.
	   2. STACKING. Above the toolbar/handle band (35), so a caution is never buried by
	      the buttons it sits beside — still well under the KeyframeStudio panel (50).
	   Bottom-anchored, so a second line grows upward rather than down into the toolbar.
	   Warm, not blue: a caution, not a status. pointer-events:none so it can never eat
	   a drag that starts near the top edge of the box. */
