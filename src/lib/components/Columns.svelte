<!--
  Columns — a thin CSS-grid wrapper for 2–3 column and media/text split layouts.

  This is also the "Split": a split IS a Columns with unequal tracks, so there is
  one component rather than two that differ only in a default. `widths` sets the
  ratio; `columns` sets an even count.

    <Columns>                     two even columns
    <Columns columns={3}>         three even columns
    <Columns widths={[3, 2]}>     a 3:2 media/text split
    <Columns widths="360px 1fr">  a fixed rail beside a fluid column

  Usage:

    <script>
      import Columns from '$lib/components/Columns.svelte';
      import Column  from '$lib/components/Column.svelte';
    </script>

    <Columns widths={[3, 2]} align="center" divider>
      <Column><img src={shot} alt="" /></Column>
      <Column>The prose beside the picture.</Column>
    </Columns>

  Props:
    columns  — even track count (default 2). Ignored when `widths` yields tracks.
    widths   — the ratio: a number array (`[3, 2]` → `3fr 2fr`), a mixed array
               (`['360px', 1]`), or your own `grid-template-columns` string.
               Junk entries are dropped; if nothing survives, `columns` decides.
    gap      — gutter between columns (any CSS length). Omit to take the theme's
               `--columns-gap`.
    align    — block-axis alignment of the columns: 'stretch' (default) | 'start'
               | 'center' | 'end' | 'baseline'. A `<Column>` may override its own.
    divider  — hairline rules in the gutters (default false). Needs `<Column>`
               children; see the caveat below.
    resizable— let a VIEWER drag the gutters during the talk (default false). In
               LAYOUT mode they are draggable regardless, `resizable` or not.
    minTrack — narrowest a track may be dragged, in canvas px (default 40).
    stack    — collapse to a single column, spans and rules included. The switch a
               slide flips when the same content wants stacking rather than splitting.
    style    — extra inline CSS appended to the group.

  Dragging a divider (see `resizable`):

  - `1fr` is a share of the space left over, so the *authored* widths can't be
    dragged — only the widths the browser resolved. Columns measures them from
    `getComputedStyle(...).gridTemplateColumns`, which is why the handles are
    client-only and never prerender.
  - A drag redistributes ONLY the two tracks the gutter separates; their sum is
    invariant, so the grid never resizes and no other divider moves.
  - It leaves the tracks as `fr` weights taken from the measured px. That is exact
    (an `fr` track gets its share of the free space, and the measured widths already
    sum to it), so nothing jumps on the first frame — but a track authored as a fixed
    `'360px'` rail comes out proportional. A drag is a RATIO editor.
  - **Nothing is saved.** Each slide is its own page load, so a drag is gone the
    moment you page away. In LAYOUT mode a `widths` chip copies the dragged ratio to
    the clipboard, to paste back into source — the same bargain every LAYOUT gesture
    makes. Double-click any divider to reset it to the authored widths.
  - A focused handle owns ←/→ (Shift for a bigger step). It is the only control in
    the deck that may: `NavigationBar` claims the arrows on `window` in the bubble
    phase, so stopping the event at a *focused* handle is both sufficient and
    scoped — the arrows page the deck again the instant focus leaves.

  Children get `min-width: 0` and the tracks are `minmax(0, 1fr)`, so a long URL or
  a wide <pre> scrolls or wraps inside its column instead of blowing the grid wider
  than the canvas — the one thing a naive grid gets wrong.

  It hugs its content in normal flow; wrap it in a <Block> to pin and size the whole
  group on a slide (Block fills its content, so the grid stretches to the box and a
  LAYOUT-mode resize rubber-bands the columns).

  Two caveats, both consequences of CSS rather than choices:

  - `divider` draws the rule as each `<Column>`'s leading edge, so it assumes ONE
    row: more children than tracks wraps them, and the first child of the second row
    would carry a rule with no column to its left. `Columns` is a single row by
    definition — the same line StatGroup's dividers draw. It also means the rule is
    exactly as tall as the column carrying it: under the default `stretch` every
    column is the row's height and the rules are full-height, while `align="center"`
    (etc.) shrinks the columns to their content and the rules with them.
  - The narrow-window collapse is `text`-mode ONLY. A presentation is authored on a
    fixed 1920x1080 canvas that SlideDeck *transform-scales* to the window, so the
    canvas is 1920px wide no matter how small the window gets: a width media query
    would fire on the window and collapse a slide that never actually narrowed. A
    Text artifact has no canvas — its width really is the window's — so there the
    columns stack under 720px, which is the only place stacking is meaningful.
