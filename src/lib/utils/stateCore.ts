/*
  State — the pure decision layer behind a deck that remembers things.

  A deck carries state in three places, and they are not interchangeable:

    - The URL (`?name=Ada`)  — shareable, survives a reload, and is the ONLY one
      a speaker can hand to an audience by reading it aloud. Untrusted: anyone
      can type anything into it.
    - localStorage           — per-browser, survives a reload, invisible to
      everyone else. Also untrusted: another tab, an older version of the deck,
      or a half-finished write can leave garbage behind.
    - A Svelte store         — per-page-load, the fastest and the most forgetful.

  What they share is that the first two are STRINGS FROM OUTSIDE, so every read
  is a parse that can fail. This module is where those parses live.

  Pure and total in the drawCore / layoutAccessCore / appendixCore tradition:
  every input may be junk — an absent param, a NaN, a value another tab
  corrupted, a 4 MB string — and each has exactly one defined answer. Nothing
  here throws, and nothing here returns NaN. That matters more than it sounds:
  `stores/diagramScroll.ts` used to read its key with a bare `parseInt`, so a
  corrupt value made the store NaN and the diagram was laid out at `NaNpx`. A
  parse that cannot fail is the fix, and it belongs here rather than in each
  store — which is where all three persisted stores now get it.

  Note what is deliberately NOT here: `browser` guards. This module never
  touches `window` or `localStorage` — it only interprets values that someone
  else read. That is what makes it testable in the SSR project as well as the
  DOM one, and it is the discipline that keeps the prerender honest.

    one-line label, and a stripped character is one the author can SEE is gone.
    Over-long input is cut to `MAX_TEXT`.

    This is NOT an XSS guard and does not pretend to be one — Svelte escapes text it
    interpolates, so `<script>` in a param renders as those literal characters and is
    inert. The danger being handled here is a LAYOUT one, which is the danger that is
    actually real. */
