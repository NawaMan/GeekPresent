// Selecting a Block brings it temporarily to the top so its body and resize grip
// stay grabbable even when Blocks overlap (Blocks otherwise paint in DOM order,
// so a lower one's grip can hide beneath a later one). This is a TRANSIENT editor
// concern — it is NOT written to source and NOT persisted across reloads. The
// PERSISTENT stacking order (an explicit `z` prop + bring-to-front / send-to-back)
// is the separate feature tracked in TODO.md.
//
// One selection at a time across the slide: because every Block reads this single
// store, selecting one clears the rest. `null` = nothing selected.
