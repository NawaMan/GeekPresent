// they publish their WHOLE opening tag (old + new) to this separate registry,
// which the page-level "Save" reads and applies as a literal source replacement
// (see $lib/layout/patchSource.ts). Kept apart from `layoutChanges` so Draw's own
// "Copy changed" — which already merges its shapes with layoutChanges Blocks —
// doesn't read its own shapes back and double-count them. String keys namespace
// each shape by its Draw instance so multiple <Draw>s on a page don't collide.
