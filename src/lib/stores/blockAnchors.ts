// The page-wide registry of NAMED <Block> boxes, keyed by `name`.
//
// This is the seam that turns Block into a diagramming primitive: a <Connector>
// looks its endpoints up here by name, so an arrow follows its boxes as they are
// dragged around in LAYOUT mode without the author touching a single coordinate.
//
// Module-level (not context) for the same reason `selectedBlock` is: a Connector
// and the Blocks it links are SIBLINGS in the slide markup, so no common provider
// exists to hang a context on.
//
// NOT browser-gated, unlike `layoutChanges` — a Connector must resolve its
// endpoints during **SSR** too, or the prerendered slide would ship an empty
// diagram. That has one consequence worth knowing:
//
//   * Blocks register as their instance code runs, which during SSR is document
//     order. So a <Connector> only sees a Block that appears BEFORE it in the
//     markup. Put connectors after the boxes they link. (In the browser it
//     self-corrects on the next flush — the store is reactive — but the
//     prerendered HTML would be missing the shaft.)
//   * Names persist between server renders (there is no onDestroy on the
//     server). Harmless: every slide re-registers its own names before its
//     connectors read them, and an unknown name simply renders nothing.
