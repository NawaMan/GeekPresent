// Public exports for the Draw module (specs/DRAW-1.md).
//
// Shapes compose as markup inside <Draw> — one component per shape, each
// rendering bare SVG elements in canvas coordinates, so a shape's tag on the
// slide diffs line-by-line and Phase 3's per-shape Copy has a tag to copy.
// Raw SVG elements pass through <Draw>'s slot as an escape hatch.
