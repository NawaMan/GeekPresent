<!--
  Sprite — a positioned, rotatable HTML element that flies along a path of
  keyframe stops. This is the KeyframeStudio "flying element" folded into the
  Draw family, so ONE surface authors both SVG shapes AND moving HTML sprites
  on one timeline:

      <Draw title="Launch">
        <Sprite name="rocket" animate={2.5} fontScale={0.84}
          stops={[
            { pct: 0,   x: 0,    y: 1025, w: 56,  h: 55,  rot: 20, ease: "ease-in"  },
            { pct: 100, x: 1528, y: 432,  w: 228, h: 219, rot: -45 },
          ]}>🚀</Sprite>
        <Line from={[…]} to={[…]} draw={2.5} />   (draws itself on the SAME bar)
      </Draw>

  HOW IT FITS THE DRAW FAMILY: like Line/Curve/Arc, the Sprite renders its own
  content + generated CSS @keyframes and only REGISTERS a ShapeEditor for
  selection / Copy — Draw hosts nothing for it. The one twist is that the
  visual is HTML, not SVG, so the moving element rides in a <foreignObject>
  spanning the canvas (SVG user units == canvas px, so a stop's x/y/w/h are
  the element's left/top/width/height with no math). The animation is pure CSS
  (left/top/width/height/transform + per-stop easing), so it prerenders and
  the AnimationBar scrubs it exactly like every other shape's animation —
  no Web Animations API, unlike the standalone KeyframeStudio.

  PATH MODE: `path={PathShape}` replaces the discrete stops with a real curve
  (line/quadratic/cubic/arc/polyline). The sprite SAMPLES it internally —
  pointAt for its centre, angleAt for the tangent it banks to (`orient`),
  `samples` frames, angle-unwrapped so the glyph never spin-flips — and
  everything downstream is the same generated CSS. In ADJUST the EDITOR is the
  curve itself: from/to + control handles like a <Curve>'s (apex grip for an
  arc, one handle per waypoint for a polyline), re-routing the flight live; no
  per-stop ghosts, no keyframe panel, and Copy/SAVE carry the literal points.

  `orient` banks the glyph to the tangent (great for a nose-up 🚀/▲). For a
  SIDE-VIEW glyph (🚚/🚗) that would flip upside down on right-to-left stretches,
  `upright` instead keeps it level and MIRRORS it to face travel — see the prop.

  ADJUST-mode editing (stop mode): each stop grows a ghost box with a MOVE
  handle (drag to reposition), a RESIZE handle (bottom-right corner) and a
  ROTATE handle; the keyframe panel retimes / adds / removes stops and sets
  per-stop easing, just like the path shapes. Geometry is edited by DRAGGING (the Draw convention),
  so the panel needs no l/t/w/h fields. Edits are finder state — Copy → paste
  is the only persistence — and every completed drag records to ADJUST undo.

  The moving element is pointer-events:none (the surface never eats input);
  only the ADJUST handles re-enable the pointer, and only in ADJUST mode.
