// Multi-presentation support.
//
// `slides/` is just one presentation; a project can hold several, each in its
// own route folder with its own `pages.ts`. A presentation's +layout.svelte
// publishes its slide list with setPages(), and the templates (TitlePage /
// ContentPage) read it with getPages() — so navigation and the Table of
// Contents are scoped to whichever presentation the slide belongs to.

    from the DOM. It combines the slide list getPages() already publishes with the live
    route, so it updates as the deck pages; the arithmetic (and its NaN-safety) lives in

//   - 'text'         — one long page, fluid width (capped 1080px), grows down.
// A reused component reads this to decide how to render in each context (e.g.
// hide the slide nav bar, anchor to the document instead of the slide). An
// artifact's +layout.svelte publishes its mode with setMode(); anything that
// doesn't is treated as a presentation.

//
// A third context a slide can find itself in, after the deck window and the presenter
// console: the HANDOUT (routes/handout/[deck].html), where every slide of a deck is stacked
// into one printable document. A slide does not change for it — the handout renders the
// very same +page.svelte — but a component may need to know, because the rules of paper
// are not the rules of a screen.
//
// <Note> is the one that does, and it is worth saying why it cannot simply read the
// display mode instead. A note is shown in SCALED display and in the presenter window,
// and hidden otherwise; but `displayMode` is PERSISTED, so a speaker who once zoomed
// into a slide would carry SCALED into the handout and get notes they never asked for.
// In the handout the question "print the notes?" has exactly one answer — the one the
// reader asked for — so the handout states it, and Note obeys it instead of guessing
// from a store that is about something else.

// View-transition navigation.
//
// By default a deck pages between slides with a full-page load (window.location)
// — route-per-slide, honest reload. A deck may instead opt into client-side
// navigation (SvelteKit goto) wrapped in the View Transitions API, so pressing
// next/prev animates one slide into the next WITHIN a single document (both
// slides are live, so there is no blank-snapshot problem the JS-mounted canvas
// would otherwise cause). The NavigationBar reads this to pick its strategy; a
// deck turns it on from its +layout.svelte with setViewTransitions(true).
