  Annotation geometry — the pure decision layer behind the ink overlay (see
  components/Annotate.svelte, stores/annotation.ts).

  Side-effect free and total, in the drawCore/connectorCore tradition: every input
  may be junk — a pointer event fired before layout settled, a zero-width rect, a
  stroke list another window wrote in an older format — and the answer is still a
  drawable result. Nothing here ever yields NaN, and nothing ever throws.

  A stroke is `Point[]` plus a tool, NOT a PathShape: the `d` string is DERIVED
  (via drawCore's smoothPath) rather than stored, so the sampled points stay the
  single source of truth and the same stroke re-renders identically on the window
  that drew it and the window that mirrors it.

/** Flatten a highlighter swipe into a LEVEL band.

    A highlighter is not a pen. Swiping over a line of text, the hand drifts and rolls, and a
    stroke that faithfully follows it comes out visibly crooked — the band slopes across the
    very line it is meant to sit on, and the smoothing then bows it for good measure. Nobody
    wants a wonky highlight; the intent was always "cover this row".

    So the band is pinned to ONE y and reduced to its horizontal extent: two points, dead
    level, so `smoothPath` degenerates to a straight segment and there is nothing left to bow.

    THE Y IS THE FIRST POINT'S — the height is chosen when you press down, and never moves
    again. The obvious-looking alternative, the mean of the samples, is what this function did
    first and it was wrong in a way only visible in the hand: the mean SHIFTS as each new
    sample arrives, so the whole band slid up and down under the cursor while the swipe was
    still being drawn. A mark that will not hold still is unusable, whatever its statistics.
    Anchoring costs nothing anyway — you set the line where you press, exactly as a physical
    highlighter does, and the swipe only ever grows sideways from there.

    A gesture with no horizontal extent is left ALONE: a vertical swipe (down a column of
    code, say) or a tap would otherwise collapse to a zero-length band, i.e. vanish. The rule
    is "level a horizontal swipe", not "forbid anything else". */

/** Snap a PEN stroke to a dead-straight X- or Y-axis line — the pen's answer to Shift.

    Underlining a line of code, or dropping a plumb line down a column, is the common
    ANNOTATE move, and a freehand hand cannot hold a straight edge on stage — the very
    reason `levelPoints` pins a HIGHLIGHTER swipe to one row. The pen has no such discipline
    of its own; this is the one it borrows while Shift is held. The stroke is reduced to the
    two points a ruler would draw: the press point, and the current point PROJECTED onto
    whichever axis the gesture has travelled furthest along.

    ANCHORED AT THE PRESS POINT, exactly as the level band is — the line grows out from where
    the pen went down and never shifts under it. It is recomputed every `pointermove` (Shift
    is a live modifier, not a commit-time flag), so the axis is free to FLIP mid-gesture as
    the dominant direction changes, and releasing Shift hands the raw freehand samples back
    untouched.

    A gesture with no travel — a tap, or a press that has not moved yet — is left ALONE
    rather than collapsed to a zero-length line: there is no dominant axis to choose, and a
    dot is a real mark (`strokeD` paints a lone point as one). This mirrors `levelPoints`
    leaving an extent-less swipe be.

    Horizontal wins a tie: an underline is the more common intent than a plumb line, and a
    dead-diagonal drag has to resolve to one axis rather than jitter between the two. */
