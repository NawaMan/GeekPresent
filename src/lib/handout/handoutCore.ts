/*
  Handout — the pure decision layer behind the whole deck as one printable document
  (see routes/handout/[deck].html, which owns the impure half: the globs, the DOM scan and
  window.print()).

  The premise is that the browser is already a PDF engine, so a handout needs no
  dependency and no export pipeline — it needs a page that stacks every slide and the
  three CSS rules that tell the printer where one slide ends and the next begins. What
  is genuinely hard is none of that: it is the ARITHMETIC of putting a 1920x1080 canvas
  onto a sheet of paper, and that is what lives here.

  Two facts make the arithmetic tractable:

  - A CSS pixel is an ABSOLUTE unit when printing: 96px is one inch, on every printer.
    So a slide authored at 1920x1080 has a true printed size, and the only question is
    what to scale it by.
  - `@page { size: … }` lets the SHEET take the slide's shape rather than the slide
    being letterboxed onto A4. A 16:9 deck prints edge-to-edge on a 16:9 page — which
    is what a conference asking for "the deck as a PDF" actually means — and a portrait
    deck (routes/portrait is 1080x1920) prints on a portrait page, from the same maths,
    with no special case.

  Total and side-effect free, in the drawCore/captureCore tradition. A deck that reports
  a zero, negative or NaN canvas yields the 1920x1080 default rather than a `NaNin` page
  size, because a malformed @page rule is not ignored by the printer — it takes the whole
  print job down to some browser default, which looks like the feature is broken.

    A real printer cannot reach the edge of the paper: given a full-bleed sheet it either crops
    the slide or shrinks it by some amount of its own choosing, and either way the deck comes
    out subtly wrong on someone else's printer. A declared margin is the deck deciding, rather
    than the hardware deciding for it.

    It is what makes a browser that IGNORES the page size below degrade gracefully. Not every
    engine honours `@page { size }` (Chrome and Edge do); one that prints on A4 instead scales
    the sheet to fit, and with the slide centred inside a margin that reads as a slide on a page
    rather than as a slide shoved into a corner.

    And — the reason it is 0.5in rather than the 0.25in it started at — THE MARGIN IS WHERE THE
    BROWSER PUTS ITS OWN HEADER AND FOOTER. Every engine prints the document title at the top of
    the sheet and the page number at the bottom (unless the reader turns them off), and it draws
    them INSIDE the page margin at a fixed inset from the paper's edge. Give it a quarter inch
    and it has nowhere to put them, so they land on top of the slide. Half an inch is the room
    they need: the title sits above the slide, the page number below it, and the slide is clear
    of both. */

    height, and both come out the same physical size.

    And the scale is derived FROM the printed pixel size rather than the printed size being
    derived from the scale. It reads backwards and it is the whole difference between a slide
    that fits the paper and one that does not: rounding the scale first (0.666650 -> 0.6667)
    made the canvas 1280.064px against 1279.968px of paper — an overhang of a tenth of a
